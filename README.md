# StableDiffusion - Textual-Inversion

![](./assets/canarinho.jpg)

If you want you can also run this repository on Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-CsyQuqKWs1NWe55nepeUBzMK0PcRHpI?usp=sharing)

The model's weights are available at [HuggingFace models](https://huggingface.co/Dimitre/stablediffusion-canarinho_pistola) and you can also find running app version at HuggingFace Spaces [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-yellow)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yuliang/ICON)

This APP loads a pre-trained StableDiffusion model using the Keras framework and fine-tunes it using the [Textual Inversion](https://textual-inversion.github.io/) process, you will also find here how to serve StableDiffusion model's components using [TFServing](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving), and how to demo it using a [Gradio](https://gradio.app) app.


# Usage
This repository has a collection of Makefile commands that covers all the functionalities provided.

```bash
make train
```
Runs the textual inversion training script, you may want to customize the `params.yaml` file.

```bash
make app
```
Starts the Gradio app, this version of the Gradio app also loads the model for inference.

```bash
make app_serving
```
Starts the Gradio app, this version of the Gradio app used the TFServing endpoints for inference.

```bash
make serve
```
Starts the TFServing instance to serve the three models from StableDiffusion, you may want to customize the `serving_config.config` file.

```bash
make lint
```
Applies code linting and formatting.

```bash
make test
```
Runs unit tests.

```bash
make jupyter
```
Starts the JupyterLab instance.

```bash
make build
```
Builds the images for the the Gradio apps and the training feature.

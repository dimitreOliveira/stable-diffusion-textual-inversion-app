# StableDiffusion - Textual-Inversion
![](https://i.imgur.com/KqEeBsM.jpg)

This APP loads a pre-trained StableDiffusion model using the Keras framework and fine-tunes it using the [Textual Inversion](https://textual-inversion.github.io/) process, you will also find here how to serve StableDiffusion model's components using [TFServing](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving), and how to demo it using a [Gradio](https://gradio.app) app.

# Usage
This repository has a collection of Makefile commands that covers all the functionalities provided.

```bash
make train
```
Runs the textual inversion training script, you may want to customize the `params.yaml` file.

```bash
make app
```
Starts the Gradio app, this version of the Gradio app also loads the model for inference.

```bash
make app_serving
```
Starts the Gradio app, this version of the Gradio app used the TFServing endpoints for inference.

```bash
make serve
```
Starts the TFServing instance to serve the three models from StableDiffusion, you may want to customize the `serving_config.config` file.

```bash
make lint
```
Applies code linting and formatting.

```bash
make test
```
Runs unit tests.

```bash
make jupyter
```
Starts the JupyterLab instance.
